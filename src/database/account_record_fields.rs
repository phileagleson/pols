# BRANCH

### Data Type Descriptions
**0**
    Main branch
**1â€“9999**
    Credit union defined branch number

A branch can be defined in Institution Branch Address parameters.

If your credit union uses branch accounting, use this field to specify the branch where share transactions should be posted. To translate share transactions to the General Ledger by branch, you must set the **GL Translation Branch Level** parameter in the Miscellaneous Parameters to **(0) Pull GL Branch from Acct Record**.

***Important:*** For NetTeller users, the query 60 processes a branch number value of three characters for check orders. When the branch number is longer than three characters, the JHADRIVER sends a blank value to NetTeller.
